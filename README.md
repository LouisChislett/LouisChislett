## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Louis Chislett, a PhD student based at the university of Edinburgh part of the HDRUK/Alan Turing Institute PhD programme in health data science. My research interests are broad, covering areas in machine learning including Deep Reinforcement Learning, classification and neural networks. My academic research currently exists in private repositories pending publications (where it will be made public), while mini-projects which I have undertaken can be perused at your leisure.

Stay tuned for my upcoming PhD work AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment), in which I have come up with a new approach to updating models in the presence of concept drift using reinforcement learning.

In my public profile you can find the following:
* A convolutional neural network approach to [image classification](https://github.com/LouisChislett/Image_Classification_App), with an accompanying demonstration app
* My competition entry to the [Wellcome Trust Ideathon 2023](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/ideathon), where I lead a team to the semi-finals
* An example of [building a Bayesian linear regression model from scratch](https://github.com/LouisChislett/Bayesian_Linear_Regression_From_Scratch/tree/main) (i.e. no libraries used) using a metropolis-hastings sampler.
* A [kaggle competion attempt](https://github.com/LouisChislett/Skin-Cancer-Detection/tree/main) which uses image and tabular data to classify instances of skin cancer
