## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Louis Chislett, a PhD student based at the university of Edinburgh part of the HDRUK/Alan Turing Institute PhD programme in health data science. My research interests are broad, covering areas in machine learning including Deep Reinforcement Learning, classification and neural networks. My academic research currently exists in private repositories pending publications (where it will be made public), while mini-projects which I have undertaken can be perused at your leisure.

Stay tuned for my upcoming PhD work AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment), in which I have come up with a new approach to updating models in the presence of concept drift using reinforcement learning.

In my public profile you can find the following:
* A convelutional neural network approach to image classification, with an accompanying demonstration
* My competition entry to the Wellcome Trust Ideathon 2023, where I lead a team to the semi-finals
* A single cell analysis pipeline in which I build an ensemble model using cell images and gene expression data to classify cells based on their function


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a Simulated Environment), in which I have come up with a new approach to updating models in the presence of concept drift using reinforcement learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: SQL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects relating to concept drift adaption in classification models
